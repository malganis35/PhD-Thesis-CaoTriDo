abstract = {Recent work in metric learning has significantly improved the state-of-the-art in k-nearest neighbor classification. Support vector machines (SVM), particularly with RBF kernels, are amongst the most popular classification algorithms that uses distance metrics to compare examples. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the efficacy of three of the most popular Mahalanobis metric learning algorithms as pre-processing for SVM training. We show that none of these algorithms generate metrics that lead to particularly satisfying improvements for SVM-RBF classification. As a remedy we introduce support vector metric learning (SVML), a novel algorithm that seamlessly combines the learning of a Mahalanobis metric with the training of the RBF-SVM parameters. We demonstrate the capabilities of SVML on nine benchmark data sets of varying sizes and difficulties. In our study, SVML outperforms all alternative state-of-the-art metric learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and establishes itself as a serious alternative to the standard Euclidean metric with model selection by cross validation.},

Electronic data repositories are growing qulckiy and contain data from commercial, scientific, and other domains. Much of this data is inherently temporal, such as stock prices or NASA telemetry data. Detecting patterns in such data streams or time series is an important knowledge discovery task.

abstract = {Event detection is a critical task in sensor networks, especially for environmental monitoring applications. Traditional solutions to event detection are based on analyzing one-shot data points, which might incur a high false alarm rate because sensor data is inherently unreliable and noisy. To address this issue, we propose a novel Distributed Single-pass Incremental Clustering (DSIC) technique to cluster the time series obtained at sensor nodes based on their underlying trends. In order to achieve scalability and energy-efficiency, our DSIC technique uses a hierarchical structure of sensor networks as the underlying infrastructure. The algorithm first compresses the time series produced at individual sensor nodes into a compact representation using Haar wavelet transform, and then, based on dynamic time warping distances, hierarchically groups the approximate time series into a global clustering model in an incremental manner. Experimental results on both real data and synthetic data demonstrate that our DSIC algorithm is accurate, energy-efficient and robust with respect to network topology changes.},

abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid forecasting approach, which combines the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM), is proposed to improve the quality of wind speed forecasting. The essence of the methodology incorporates three phases. First, the original data of wind speed are decomposed into a number of independent Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and one residual series by EEMD using the principle of decomposition. In order to forecast these IMFs, excepting the highest frequency acquired by EEMD, the respective estimates are yielded using the SVM algorithm. Finally, these respective estimates are combined into the final wind speed forecasts using the principle of ensemble. The proposed hybrid method is examined by forecasting the mean monthly wind speed of three wind farms located in northwest China. The obtained results confirm an observable improvement for the forecasting validity of the proposed hybrid approach. This tool shows great promise for the forecasting of intricate time series which are intrinsically highly volatile and irregular. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations, data items, or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval.},

Under the distributed output code developed by Sejnowski and Rosenberg, it is shown that BP consistently out-performs ID3 on this task by several percentage points. Three hypotheses explaining this difference were explored: (a) ID3 is overfitting the training data, (b) BP is able to share hidden units across several output units and hence can learn the output units better, and (c) BP captures statistical information that ID3 does not. We conclude that only hypothesis (c) is correct. By augmenting ID3 with a simple statistical learning procedure, the performance of BP can be closely matched. More complex statistical procedures can improve the performance of both BP and ID3 substantially in this domain.},

abstract = {While most time series data mining research has concentrated on providing solutions for a single distance function, in this work we motivate the need for an index structure that can support multiple distance measures. Our specific area of interest is the efficient retrieval and analysis of similar trajectories. Trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications, mobility experiments, and video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure is based on the longest common subsequence (LCSS) model that offers enhanced robustness, particularly for noisy data, which are encountered very often in real-world applications. However, our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well, including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance and the increasingly popular dynamic time warping (DTW). While other researchers have advocated one or other of these similarity measures, a major contribution of our work is the ability to support all these measures without the need to restructure the index. Our framework guarantees no false dismissals and can also be tailored to provide much faster response time at the expense of slightly reduced precision/recall. The experimental results demonstrate that our index can help speed up the computation of expensive similarity measures such as the LCSS and the DTW.},

In the presence of full knowledge of the underlying probabilities, Bayes decision theory gives optimal error rates. In those cases where this information is not present, many algorithms make use of distance or similarity among samples as a means of classification. The K-nearest neighbor decision rule has often been used in these pattern recognition problems. One of the difficulties that arises when utilizing this technique is that each of the labeled samples is given equal importance in deciding the class memberships of the pattern to be classified, regardless of their `typicalness'. The theory of fuzzy sets is introduced into the K-nearest neighbor technique to develop a fuzzy version of the algorithm. Three methods of assigning fuzzy memberships to the labeled samples are proposed, and experimental results and comparisons to the crisp version are presented.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Reductions in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke have been shown to attenuate the risk of cardiovascular disease. We examined whether the 2003 implementation of a comprehensive smoking ban in New York State was associated with reduced hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction and stroke, beyond the effect of moderate, local and statewide smoking restrictions, and independent of secular trends. METHODS: We analyzed trends in county-level, age-adjusted, monthly hospital admission rates for acute myocardial infarction and stroke from 1995 to 2004 to identify any association between admission rates and implementation of the smoking ban. We used regression models to adjust for the effects of pre-existing smoking restrictions, seasonal trends in admissions, differences across counties, and secular trends. RESULTS: In 2004, there were 3813 fewer hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction than would have been expected in the absence of the comprehensive smoking ban. Direct health care cost savings of {\$}56 million were realized in 2004. There was no reduction in the number of admissions for stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admission rates for acute myocardial infarction were reduced by 8{\%} as a result of a comprehensive smoking ban in New York State after we controlled for other relevant factors.

The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L1 norm in the target space approximates the "semantic" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions.

We propose in this work a framework to learn a combination of multiple metrics for a robust kNN classier. This combined metric includes both temporal (value and behavior) and frequential components. By introducing the concept of pairwise space, the combination function is learned in this new space through a "large margin" optimization process. The effciency of the learned metric is compared to the major alternative metrics on large public datasets.},

One key component in cluster analysis is determining a proper dissimilarity mea- sure between two data objects, and many criteria have been proposed in the literature to assess dissimilarity between two time series. The R package TSclust is aimed to im- plement a large set of well-established peer-reviewed time series dissimilarity measures, including measures based on raw data, extracted features, underlying parametric models, complexity levels, and forecast behaviors. Computation of these measures allows the user to perform clustering by using conventional clustering algorithms. TSclust also includes a clustering procedure based on p values from checking the equality of generating models, and some utilities to evaluate cluster solutions. The implemented dissimilarity functions are accessible individually for an easier extension and possible use out of the clustering context. The main features of TSclust are described and examples of its use are presented.},

abstract = {Time series of remote sensing imagery or derived vegetation indices and biophysical products have been shown particularly useful to characterize land ecosystem dynamics. Various methods have been developed based on temporal trajectory analysis to characterize, classify and detect changes in ecosystem dynamics. Although time series similarity measures play an important role in these methods, a quantitative comparison of the similarity measures is lacking. The objective of this study was to provide an overview and quantitative comparison of the similarity measures in function of varying time series and ecosystem characteristics, such as amplitude, timing and noise effects. For this purpose, the performance was evaluated for the commonly used similarity measures (D), ranging from Manhattan (DMan), Euclidean (DE) and Mahalanobis (DMah) distance measures, to correlation (DCC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA; DPCA) and Fourier based (DFFT,D$\xi$,DFk) similarities. The quantitative comparison consists of a series of Monte-Carlo simulations based on subsets of global MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data. Results of the simulations reveal four main groups of time series similarity measures with different sensitivities: (i) DMan, DE, DPCA, DFk quantify the difference in time series values, (ii) DMah accounts for temporal correlation and non-stationarity of variance, (iii) DCC measures the temporal correlation, and (iv) the Fourier based DFFT and D$\xi$ show their specific sensitivity based on the selected Fourier components. The difference measures show relatively the highest sensitivity to amplitude effects, whereas the correlation based measures are highly sensitive to variations in timing and noise. The Fourier based measures, finally, depend highly on the signal to noise ratio and the balance between amplitude and phase dominance. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of each D stresses the importance of (i) understanding the time series characteristics before applying any classification of change detection approach and (ii) defining the variability one wants to identify/account for. This requires an understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and time series characteristics related to the baseline, amplitude, timing, noise and variability of the ecosystem time series. This is also illustrated in the quantitative comparison, where the different sensitivities of D for the NDVI, EVI, and LAI data relate specifically to the temporal characteristics of each data set. Additionally, the effect of noise and intra- and interclass variability is demonstrated in a case study based on land cover classification.},

abstract = {The need for appropriate ways to measure the distance or similarity between data is ubiquitous in machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining, but handcrafting such good metrics for specific problems is generally difficult. This has led to the emergence of metric learning, which aims at automatically learning a metric from data and has attracted a lot of interest in machine learning and related fields for the past ten years. This survey paper proposes a systematic review of the metric learning literature, highlighting the pros and cons of each approach. We pay particular attention to Mahalanobis distance metric learning, a well-studied and successful framework, but additionally present a wide range of methods that have recently emerged as powerful alternatives, including nonlinear metric learning, similarity learning and local metric learning. Recent trends and extensions, such as semi-supervised metric learning, metric learning for histogram data and the derivation of generalization guarantees, are also covered. Finally, this survey addresses metric learning for structured data, in particular edit distance learning, and attempts to give an overview of the remaining challenges in metric learning for the years to come.},

abstract = {Usually, objects to be classified are represented by features. In this paper, we discuss an alternative object representation based on dissimilarity values. If such distances separate the classes well, the nearest neighbor method offers a good solution. However, dissimilarities used in practice are usually far from ideal and the performance of the nearest neighbor rule suffers from its sensitivity to noisy examples. We show that other, more global classification techniques are preferable to the nearest neighbor rule, in such cases.For classification purposes, two different ways of using generalized dissimilarity kernels are considered. In the first one, distances are isometrically embedded in a pseudo-Euclidean space and the classification task is performed there. In the second approach, classifiers are built directly on distance kernels. Both approaches are described theoretically and then compared using experiments with different dissimilarity measures and datasets including degraded data simulating the problem of missing values. http://www.crossref.org/jmlr{\_}DOI.html},

Using these features, multiple SVM classifiers are trained to separate different classes of digits.

Based on this database, differences between Arabic and Persian digits in digit recognition are shown.

abstract = {The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification depends significantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.},

Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

abstract = {The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification depends significantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Maha- lanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a largemargin. As in support vectormachines (SVMs), themargin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach re- quires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.

abstract = {In this paper we describe the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines. Our starting point is a generalized notion of the margin to multiclass problems. Using this notion we cast multiclass categorization problems as a constrained optimization problem with a quadratic objective function. Unlike most of previous approaches which typically decompose a multiclass problem into multiple independent binary classification tasks, our notion of margin yields a direct method for training multiclass predictors. By using the dual of the optimization problem we are able to incorporate kernels with a compact set of constraints and decompose the dual problem into multiple optimization problems of reduced size. We describe an efficient fixed-point algorithm for solving the reduced optimization problems and prove its convergence. We then discuss technical details that yield significant running time improvements for large datasets. Finally, we describe various experiments with our approach comparing it to previously studied kernel-based methods. Our experiments indicate that for multiclass problems we attain state-of-the-art accuracy},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

First, the criterion relies on an adaptive (i.e., parameterized) time series metric to cover both behaviors and values proximities. The metrics parameters may change from one internal node to another to achieve the best bisection of the set of time series. Second, the criterion involves the automatic extraction of the most discriminating subsequences. The proposed time series classification tree is applied to a wide range of datasets: public and new, real and synthetic, univariate and multivariate data.

abstract = {Zero-inflated time series data are commonly encountered in many applications, including climate and ecological modeling, disease monitoring, manufacturing defect detection, and traffic monitoring. Such data often leads to poor model fitting using standard regression methods because they tend to underestimate the frequency of zeros and the magnitude of non-zero values. This paper presents an integrated framework that simultaneously performs classification and regression to accurately predict future values of a zero-inflated time series. A regression model is initially applied to predict the value of the time series. The regression output is then fed into a classification model to determine whether the predicted value should be adjusted to zero. Our regression and classification models are trained to optimize a joint objective function that considers both classification errors on the time series and regression errors on data points that have non-zero values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in the context of its application to a precipitation downscaling problem for climate impact assessment studies.

abstract = {This paper proposes an extension of classification trees to time series input variables. A new split criterion based on time series proximities is introduced. First, the criterion relies on an adaptive (i.e., parameterized) time series metric to cover both behaviors and values proximities. The metrics parameters may change from one internal node to another to achieve the best bisection of the set of time series. Second, the criterion involves the automatic extraction of the most discriminating subsequences. The proposed time series classification tree is applied to a wide range of datasets: public and new, real and synthetic, univariate and multivariate data. We show, through the experiments performed in this study, that the proposed tree outperforms temporal trees using standard time series distances and performs well compared to other competitive time series classifiers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the component system we first locate facial components, extract them and combine them into a single feature vector which is classified by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The two global systems recognize faces by classifying a single feature vector consisting of the gray values of the whole face image. In the first global system we trained a single SVM classifier for each person in the database. The second system consists of sets of viewpoint-specific SVM classifiers and involves clustering during training. We performed extensive tests on a database which included faces rotated up to about 40° in depth. The component system clearly outperformed both global systems on all tests.},

abstract = {The problem of indexing time series has attracted much interest. Most algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some variation thereof. However, it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dy- namic time warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this flexi- bility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately, however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequential searches. In this work, we intro- duce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.},

The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovm{\"{o}}ller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Ni{\~{n}}o3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880–1920 and 1960–90, and lower power during 1920–60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance.

abstract = {Dynamic time warping (DTW), which finds the minimum path by providing non-linear alignments between two time series, has been widely used as a distance measure for time series classification and clustering. However, DTW does not account for the relative importance regarding the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. This may lead to misclassification especially in applications where the shape similarity between two sequences is a major consideration for an accurate recognition. Therefore, we propose a novel distance measure, called a weighted DTW (WDTW), which is a penalty-based DTW. Our approach penalizes points with higher phase difference between a reference point and a testing point in order to prevent minimum distance distortion caused by outliers. The rationale underlying the proposed distance measure is demonstrated with some illustrative examples. A new weight function, called the modified logistic weight function (MLWF), is also proposed to systematically assign weights as a function of the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. By applying different weights to adjacent points, the proposed algorithm can enhance the detection of similarity between two time series. We show that some popular distance measures such as DTW and Euclidean distance are special cases of our proposed WDTW measure. We extend the proposed idea to other variants of DTW such as derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and propose the weighted version of DDTW. We have compared the performances of our proposed procedures with other popular approaches using public data sets available through the UCR Time Series Data Mining Archive for both time series classification and clustering problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approaches can achieve improved accuracy for time series classification and clustering problems.},

We review these alternatives and benchmark them against competitive methods such as the related Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification (LMNN) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. As we expected, we find that the DTW is superior, but the Mahalanobis distance measures are one to two orders of magnitude faster.

In this paper, we propose an approach to edit similarity learning based on loss minimization, called GESL. It is driven by the notion of (ϵ,$\gamma$,$\tau$)-goodness, a theory that bridges the gap between the properties of a similarity function and its performance in classification. Using the notion of uniform stability, we derive generalization guarantees that hold for a large class of loss functions. We also provide experimental results on two real-world datasets which show that edit similarities learned with GESL induce more accurate and sparser classifiers than other (standard or learned) edit similarities.},

abstract = {Zero-inflated time series data are commonly encountered in many applications, including climate and ecological modeling, disease monitoring, manufacturing defect detection, and traffic monitoring. Such data often leads to poor model fitting using standard regression methods because they tend to underestimate the frequency of zeros and the magnitude of non-zero values. This paper presents an integrated framework that simultaneously performs classification and regression to accurately predict future values of a zero-inflated time series. A regression model is initially applied to predict the value of the time series. The regression output is then fed into a classification model to determine whether the predicted value should be adjusted to zero. Our regression and classification models are trained to optimize a joint objective function that considers both classification errors on the time series and regression errors on data points that have non-zero values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in the context of its application to a precipitation downscaling problem for climate impact assessment studies.

In our  framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by 1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, 2) using  the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the  shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus  offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts,  enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the  transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this  purpose. The dissimilarity between the two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together  with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as  the problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar to that in the image.

The major limitation of these proximity measures is that they are based on the closeness of the values regardless of the similarity w.r.t. the growth behavior of the time series. To alleviate this drawback we propose a new dissimilarity index, based on an automatic adaptive tuning function, to include both proximity measures w.r.t. values and w.r.t. behavior.

When working with time series, the concept of similarity can be established in different ways. In this paper, several non-parametric statistics originally designed to test the equality of the log-spectra of two stochastic processes are proposed as dissimilarity measures between time series data. Their behavior in time series clustering is analyzed throughout a simulation study, and compared with the performance of several model-free and model-based dissimilarity measures. Up to three different classification settings were considered: (i) to distinguish between stationary and non-stationary time series, (ii) to classify different ARMA processes and (iii) to classify several non-linear time series models. As it was expected, the performance of a particular dissimilarity metric strongly depended on the type of processes subjected to clustering. Among all the measures studied, the non-parametric distances showed the most robust behavior.},

abstract = {Human experts constitute pattern classes of natural objects based on their observed appearance. Automatic systems for pattern recognition may be designed on a structural description derived from sensor observations. Alternatively, training sets of examples can be used in statistical learning procedures. They are most powerful for vectorial object representations. Unfortunately, structural descriptions do not match well with vectorial representations. Consequently it is difficult to combine the structural and statistical approaches to pattern recognition. Structural descriptions may be used to compare objects. This leads to a set of pairwise dissimilarities from which vectors can be derived for the purpose of statistical learning. The resulting dissimilarity representation bridges thereby the structural and statistical approaches. The dissimilarity space is one of the possible spaces resulting from this representation. It is very general and easy to implement. This paper gives a historical review and discusses the properties of the dissimilarity space approaches illustrated by a set of examples on real world datasets. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L1 norm in the target space approximates the "semantic" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression, position, and artificial occlusions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves.},

abstract = {Distance metric learning plays a very crucial role in many data mining algorithms because the performance of an algorithm relies heavily on choosing a good metric. However, the labeled data available in many applications is scarce and hence the metrics learned are often unsatisfactory. In this paper, we consider a transfer learning setting in which some related source tasks with labeled data are available to help the learning of the target task. We first propose a convex formulation for multi-task metric learning by modeling the task relationships in the form of a task covariance matrix. Then we regard transfer learning as a special case of multitask learning and adapt the formulation of multi-task metric learning to the transfer learning setting for our method, called transfer metric learning (TML). In TML, we learn the metric and the task covariances between the source tasks and the target task under a unified convex formulation. To solve the convex optimization problem, we use an alternating method in which each subproblem has an efficient solution. Experimental results on some commonly used transfer learning applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © 2010 ACM.},

However, in many data stream applications, streaming data contains inherent uncertainty, and labeled samples are difficult to be collected, while abundant data are unlabeled. In this paper, we focus on classifying uncertain data streams with only positive and unlabeled samples available. Based on concept-adapting very fast decision tree (CVFDT) algorithm, we propose an algorithm namely puuCVFDT (CVFDT for positive and unlabeled uncertain data). Experimental results on both synthetic and real-life datasets demonstrate the strong ability and efficiency of puuCVFDT to handle concept drift with uncertainty under positive and unlabeled learning scenario. Even when 90{\%} of the samples in the stream are unlabeled, the classification performance of the proposed algorithm is still compared to that of CVFDT, which is learned from fully labeled data without uncertainty. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

@article{DUrso2009,
abstract = {The traditional approaches to clustering a set of time series are generally applicable if there is a fixed underlying structure to the time series so that each will belong to one cluster or the other. However, time series often display dynamic behaviour in their evolution over time. This dynamic behaviour should be taken into account when attempting to cluster time series. For instance, during a certain period, a time series might belong to a certain cluster; afterwards its dynamics might be closer to that of another cluster. In this case, the traditional clustering approaches are unlikely to find and represent the underlying structure in the given time series. This switch from one time state to another, which is typically vague, can be naturally treated following a fuzzy approach. This paper proposes a fuzzy clustering approach based on the autocorrelation functions of time series, in which each time series is not assigned exclusively to only one cluster, but it is allowed to belong to different clusters with various membership degrees. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In more detail, we use a sliding window over the data sequence and extract its features; the result is a trail in feature space. We propose an efficient and effective algorithm to divide such trails into sub-trails, which are subsequently represented by their Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs). We also examine queries of varying lengths, and we show how to handle each case eciently. We implemented our method and carried out experiments on synthetic and real data (stock price movements).

abstract = {Gene expression levels are often measured consecutively in time through microarray experiments to detect cellular processes underlying regulatory effects observed and to assign functionality to genes whose function is yet unknown. Clustering methods allow us to group genes that show similar time-course expression profiles and that are thus likely to be co-regulated. The correlation coefficient, the most well-liked similarity measure in the context of gene expression data, is not very reliable in representing the association of two temporal profile patterns. Moreover, the clustering methods with the correlation coefficient generate the same clustering result even when the time points are permuted arbitrarily. We propose a new similarity measure for clustering time-course gene expression data. The proposed measure is based on the correlation coefficient and the two indices representing the concordance of temporal profile patterns and that of the time points at which maximum and minimum expression levels are measured between two profiles, respectively. We applied the hierarchical clustering method with the proposed similarity measure to both synthetic and breast cancer cell line data. We observed favorable results compared to the correlation coefficient based method. The proposed similarity measure is simple to implement, and it is much more consistent for clustering than the correlation coefficient based method according to the cross-validation criterion.},

abstract = {Standard Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) computation technique utilizes discrete cosine transform (DCT) for decorrelating log energies of filter bank output. The use of DCT is reasonable here as the covariance matrix of Mel filter bank log energy (MFLE) can be compared with that of highly correlated Markov-I process. This full-band based MFCC computation technique where each of the filter bank output has contribution to all coefficients, has two main disadvantages. First, the covariance matrix of the log energies does not exactly follow Markov-I property. Second, full-band based MFCC feature gets severely degraded when speech signal is corrupted with narrow-band channel noise, though few filter bank outputs may remain unaffected. In this work, we have studied a class of linear transformation techniques based on block wise transformation of MFLE which effectively decorrelate the filter bank log energies and also capture speech information in an efficient manner. A thorough study has been carried out on the block based transformation approach by investigating a new partitioning technique that highlights associated advantages. This article also reports a novel feature extraction scheme which captures complementary information to wide band information; that otherwise remains undetected by standard MFCC and proposed block transform (BT) techniques. The proposed features are evaluated on NIST SRE databases using Gaussian mixture model-universal background model (GMM-UBM) based speaker recognition system. We have obtained significant performance improvement over baseline features for both matched and mismatched condition, also for standard and narrow-band noises. The proposed method achieves significant performance improvement in presence of narrow-band noise when clubbed with missing feature theory based score computation scheme. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This approach has one weakness, however; it is computationally too demanding for many realtime applications. One way to mitigate this problem is to speed up the DTW calculations. Nonetheless, there is a limit to how much this can help. In this work, we propose an additional technique, numerosity reduction, to speed up one-nearest-neighbor DTW. While the idea of numerosity reduction for nearest-neighbor classifiers has a long history, we show here that we can leverage off an original observation about the relationship between dataset size and DTW constraints to produce an extremely compact dataset with little or no loss in accuracy. We test our ideas with a comprehensive set of experiments, and show that it can efficiently produce extremely fast accurate classifiers.},

Our work proposes a new algorithm, called the Fast Time Series Evaluation (FTSE) method, which can be used to evaluate such threshold value techniques, including LCSS and EDR. Using FTSE,we show that these techniques can be evaluated faster than using either traditional dynamic programming or even warp-restricting methods such as the Sakoe-Chiba band and the Itakura Parallelogram. We also show that FTSE can be used in a framework that can evaluate a richer range of epsilon threshold-based scoring techniques, of which EDR and LCSS are just two examples. This framework, called Swale, extends the epsilon threshold-based scoring techniques to include arbitrary match rewards and gap penalties. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we show that Swale can obtain greater accuracy than existing methods.},

Such an unbiased way to proceed requires to optimise the parameters of a conditional transducer instead of a joint one. We apply our new model in the context of handwritten digit recognition. We show, carrying out a large series of experiments, that it always outperforms the standard edit distance. ?? 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.},
