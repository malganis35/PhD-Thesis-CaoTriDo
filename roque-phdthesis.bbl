  Nonparametric regression is a set of techniques for es- timating a regression
  curve without making strong as- sumptions about the shape of the true

  Zero-inflated time series data are commonly encountered in many applications,
  including climate and ecological modeling, disease monitoring, manufacturing
  defect detection, and traffic monitoring. Such data often leads to poor model
  fitting using standard regression methods because they tend to underestimate
  the frequency of zeros and the magnitude of non-zero values. This paper
  presents an integrated framework that simultaneously performs classification
  and regression to accurately predict future values of a zero-inflated time
  series. A regression model is initially applied to predict the value of the
  time series. The regression output is then fed into a classification model to
  determine whether the predicted value should be adjusted to zero. Our
  regression and classification models are trained to optimize a joint
  objective function that considers both classification errors on the time
  series and regression errors on data points that have non-zero values. We
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in the context of its
  application to a precipitation downscaling problem for climate impact
  assessment studies. Read More:

  Knowledge discovery in databases presents many interesting challenges within
  the context of providing computer tools for exploring large data archives.
  Electronic data repositories are growing qulckiy and contain data from
  commercial, scientific, and other domains. Much of this data is inherently
  temporal, such as stock prices or NASA telemetry data. Detecting patterns in
  such data streams or time series is an important knowledge discovery task.
  This paper describes some primary experiments with a dynamic programming
  approach to the problem. The pattern detection algorithm is based on the
  dynamic time warping technique used in the speech recognition field.

  Similarity functions are a fundamental component of many learning algorithms.
  When dealing with string or tree-structured data, measures based on the edit
  distance are widely used, and there exist a few methods for learning them
  from data. However, these methods offer no theoretical guarantee as to the
  generalization ability and discriminative power of the learned similarities.
  In this paper, we propose an approach to edit similarity learning based on
  loss minimization, called GESL. It is driven by the notion of
  (Ïµ,$\gamma$,$\tau$)-goodness, a theory that bridges the gap between the
  properties of a similarity function and its performance in classification.
  Using the notion of uniform stability, we derive generalization guarantees
  that hold for a large class of loss functions. We also provide experimental
  results on two real-world datasets which show that edit similarities learned
  with GESL induce more accurate and sparser classifiers than other (standard
  or learned) edit similarities.%

  The need for appropriate ways to measure the distance or similarity between
  data is ubiquitous in machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining,
  but handcrafting such good metrics for specific problems is generally
  difficult. This has led to the emergence of metric learning, which aims at
  automatically learning a metric from data and has attracted a lot of interest
  in machine learning and related fields for the past ten years. This survey
  paper proposes a systematic review of the metric learning literature,
  highlighting the pros and cons of each approach. We pay particular attention
  to Mahalanobis distance metric learning, a well-studied and successful
  framework, but additionally present a wide range of methods that have
  recently emerged as powerful alternatives, including nonlinear metric
  learning, similarity learning and local metric learning. Recent trends and
  extensions, such as semi-supervised metric learning, metric learning for
  histogram data and the derivation of generalization guarantees, are also
  covered. Finally, this survey addresses metric learning for structured data,
  in particular edit distance learning, and attempts to give an overview of the
  remaining challenges in metric learning for the years to come.%

  The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the
  last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the
  underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have
  grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models
  have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic
  techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly
  enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms
  such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based
  on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications.
  This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while
  providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition
  and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year
  PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge
  of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity
  with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some
  experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential
  as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability
  theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics,
  computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and
  bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors,
  including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example
  solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site,
  while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the
  publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and
  the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest
  information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects
  of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software
  implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and
  demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft
  Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the
  University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was
  recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's
  previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely
  adopted.%

  We present a novel approach to measuring similarity between shapes and
  exploit it for object recognition. In our framework, the measurement of
  similarity is preceded by 1) solving for correspondences between points on
  the two shapes, 2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning
  transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a
  descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a
  reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to
  it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding
  points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to
  solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point
  correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two
  shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of
  transformation maps for this purpose. The dissimilarity between the two
  shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points,
  together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We
  treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as the
  problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar to
  that in the image. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks,
  handwritten digits, and the COIL data set.%

  Individual-differences multidimensional scaling (INDSCAL) determined the
  dimensions underlying ratings of electrocutaneous stimuli, which ranged from
  innocuous levels to individual pain intolerance at each of three frequencies.
  Twenty-five healthy males made pairwise similarity judgments of these 15
  stimuli for the INDSCAL procedure, and then rated each stimulus on nine
  property scales. Signal detection theory indices, as well as ratings on the
  McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), were also obtained. A Sensory Magnitude
  dimension scaled the stimuli from lowest to highest perceived intensity; this
  dimension was related to sensory, affective, and arousal property scales. A
  Frequency dimension ordered the stimuli from lowest to highest frequency;
  this dimension was related to the Fast-Slow property. Compared to the
  Frequency dimension, the Sensory Magnitude dimension was more salient to
  subjects who better discriminated among painful stimulus intensities, set a
  more stoical pain report criterion, and were less apt to endorse
  frequency-related MPQ descriptors. Thus, variation of physical intensity and
  frequency elicited complementary dimensions of subjective judgment, which
  were related to perceptual and attitudinal differences among individuals.%

  The statistical discrimination and clustering literature has studied the
  problem of identifying similarities in time series data. Some studies use
  non-parametric approaches for splitting a set of time series into clusters by
  looking at their Euclidean distances in the space of points. A new measure of
  distance between time series based on the normalized periodogram is proposed.
  Simulation results comparing this measure with others parametric and
  non-parametric metrics are provided. In particular, the classification of
  time series as stationary or as non-stationary is discussed. The use of both
  hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering algorithms is considered. An
  illustrative example with economic time series data is also presented. Â©

  The nearest neighbor decision rule assigns to an unclassified sample point
  the classification of the nearest of a set of previously classified points.
  This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample
  points and their classifications, and hence the probability of
  error<tex>R</tex>of such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes
  probability of error<tex>R{\^{}}{\{}ast{\}}</tex>--the minimum probability of
  error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into
  account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in
  the<tex>M</tex>-category case that<tex>R{\^{}}{\{}ast{\}} leq R leq
  R{\^{}}{\{}ast{\}}(2 --MR{\^{}}{\{}ast{\}}/(M-1))</tex>, where these bounds
  are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions.
  Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest
  neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In
  this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an
  infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.%

  In this paper, the authors present an evaluation of a new biometric based on
  electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms. ECG data were collected from 50 subjects
  during three data-recording sessions on different days using a simple user
  interface, where subjects held two electrodes on the pads of their thumbs
  using their thumb and index fingers. Data from session 1 were used to
  establish an enrolled database, and data from the remaining two sessions were
  used as test cases. Classification was performed using three different
  quantitative measures: percent residual difference, correlation coefficient,
  and a novel distance measure based on wavelet transform. The wavelet distance
  measure has a classification accuracy of 89{\%}, outperforming the other
  methods by nearly 10{\%}. This ECG person-identification modality would be a
  useful supplement for conventional biometrics, such as fingerprint and palm
  recognition systems.%

  This paper focuses on developing a new framework of kernelizing Mahalanobis
  distance learners. The new KPCA trick framework offers several practical
  advantages over the classical kernel trick framework, e.g. no mathematical
  formulas and no reprogramming are required for a kernel implementation, a way
  to speed up an algorithm is provided with no extra work, the framework avoids
  troublesome problems such as singularity. Rigorous representer theorems in
  countably infinite dimensional spaces are given to validate our framework.
  Furthermore, unlike previous works which always apply brute force methods to
  select a kernel, we derive a kernel alignment formula based on quadratic
  programming which can efficiently construct an appropriate kernel for a given
  dataset. ?? 2010.%

  In this paper we describe the algorithmic implementation of multiclass
  kernel-based vector machines. Our starting point is a generalized notion of
  the margin to multiclass problems. Using this notion we cast multiclass
  categorization problems as a constrained optimization problem with a
  quadratic objective function. Unlike most of previous approaches which
  typically decompose a multiclass problem into multiple independent binary
  classification tasks, our notion of margin yields a direct method for
  training multiclass predictors. By using the dual of the optimization problem
  we are able to incorporate kernels with a compact set of constraints and
  decompose the dual problem into multiple optimization problems of reduced
  size. We describe an efficient fixed-point algorithm for solving the reduced
  optimization problems and prove its convergence. We then discuss technical
  details that yield significant running time improvements for large datasets.
  Finally, we describe various experiments with our approach comparing it to
  previously studied kernel-based methods. Our experiments indicate that for
  multiclass problems we attain state-of-the-art accuracy%

  The support-vector network is a new leaming machine for two-group
  classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following
  idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high- dimension feature
  space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed.
  Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization
  ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network
  was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data
  can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable
  training data. High generalization ability of support-vector networks
  utilizing polynomial input transformations is demon- strated. We also compare
  the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning
  algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character

  This paper proposes an extension of classification trees to time series input
  variables. A new split criterion based on time series proximities is
  introduced. First, the criterion relies on an adaptive (i.e., parameterized)
  time series metric to cover both behaviors and values proximities. The
  metrics parameters may change from one internal node to another to achieve
  the best bisection of the set of time series. Second, the criterion involves
  the automatic extraction of the most discriminating subsequences. The
  proposed time series classification tree is applied to a wide range of
  datasets: public and new, real and synthetic, univariate and multivariate
  data. We show, through the experiments performed in this study, that the
  proposed tree outperforms temporal trees using standard time series distances
  and performs well compared to other competitive time series classifiers%

  Abstract The most widely used measures of time series proximity are the
  Euclidean distance and dynamic time warping. The latter can be derived from
  the distance introduced by Maurice Frchet in 1906 to account for the
  proximity between curves. The major limitation of these proximity measures is
  that they are based on the closeness of the values regardless of the
  similarity w.r.t. the growth behavior of the time series. To alleviate this
  drawback we propose a new dissimilarity index, based on an automatic adaptive
  tuning function, to include both proximity measures w.r.t. values and w.r.t.
  behavior. A comparative numerical analysis between the proposed index and the
  classical distance measures is performed on the basis of two datasets: a
  synthetic dataset and a dataset from a public health study.%

  In this paper, the problem of classifying an unseen pattern on the basis of
  its nearest neighbors in a recorded data set is addressed from the point of
  view of Dempster-Shafer theory. Each neighbor of a sample to be classified is
  considered as an item of evidence that supports certain hypotheses regarding
  the class membership of that pattern. The degree of support is defined as a
  function of the distance between the two vectors. The evidence of the k
  nearest neighbors is then pooled by means of Dempster's rule of combination.
  This approach provides a global treatment of such issues as ambiguity and
  distance rejection, and imperfect knowledge regarding the class membership of
  training patterns. The effectiveness of this classification scheme as
  compared to the voting and distance-weighted k-NN procedures is demonstrated
  using several sets of simulated and real-world data%

  The performance of the error backpropagation (BP) and ID3 learning algorithms
  was compared on the task of mapping English text to phonemes and stresses.
  Under the distributed output code developed by Sejnowski and Rosenberg, it is
  shown that BP consistently out-performs ID3 on this task by several
  percentage points. Three hypotheses explaining this difference were explored:
  (a) ID3 is overfitting the training data, (b) BP is able to share hidden
  units across several output units and hence can learn the output units
  better, and (c) BP captures statistical information that ID3 does not. We
  conclude that only hypothesis (c) is correct. By augmenting ID3 with a simple
  statistical learning procedure, the performance of BP can be closely matched.
  More complex statistical procedures can improve the performance of both BP
  and ID3 substantially in this domain.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growths of interests in
  applications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Numerous
  representation methods for dimensionality reduction and similarity measures
  geared towards time series have been introduced. Each individual work
  introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the
  occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental
  observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these
  experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the
  proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to
  provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive set of time
  series experiments re-implementing 8 different representation methods and 9
  similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38
  time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this
  paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our
  comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Our
  experiments have provided both a unified validation of some of the existing
  achievements, and in some cases, suggested that certain claims in the
  literature may be unduly optimistic. 1.%

  En une vingtaine dâann{\'{e}}es, lâapprentissage artificiel est devenu
  une branche majeure des math{\'{e}}matiques appliqu{\'{e}}es, {\`{a}}
  lâintersection des statistiques et de lâintelligence artificielle. Son
  objectif est de r{\'{e}}aliser des mod{\`{e}}les qui apprennent Â« par
  lâexemple Â» : il sâappuie sur des donn{\'{e}}es num{\'{e}}riques
  (r{\'{e}}sultats de mesures ou de simulations), contrairement aux
  mod{\`{e}}les Â« de connaissances Â» qui sâappuient sur des {\'{e}}quations
  issues des premiers principes de la physique, de la chimie, de la biologie,
  de lâ{\'{e}}conomie, etc. Lâapprentis- sage statistique est dâune
  grande utilit{\'{e}} lorsque lâon cherche {\`{a}} mod{\'{e}}liser des
  processus complexes, souvent non lin{\'{e}}aires, pour lesquels les
  connaissances th{\'{e}}oriques sont trop impr{\'{e}}cises pour permettre des
  pr{\'{e}}dictions pr{\'{e}}cises. Ses domaines dâapplications sont
  multiples : fouille de donn{\'{e}}es, bio-informatique, g{\'{e}}nie des
  proc{\'{e}}d{\'{e}}s, aide au diagnostic m{\'{e}}dical,
  t{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}communications, interface cerveau-machines, et bien
  dâautres. Cet ouvrage refl{\`{e}}te en partie lâ{\'{e}}volution de cette
  discipline, depuis ses balbutiements au d{\'{e}}but des ann{\'{e}}es 1980,
  jusquâ{\`{a}} sa situation actuelle ; il nâa pas du tout la
  pr{\'{e}}tention de faire un point, m{\^{e}}me partiel, sur lâensemble des
  d{\'{e}}veloppements pass{\'{e}}s et actuels, mais plut{\^{o}}t dâinsister
  sur les principes et sur les m{\'{e}}thodes {\'{e}}prouv{\'{e}}s, dont les
  bases scientifiques sont s{\^{u}}res. Dans un domaine sans cesse parcouru de
  modes multiples et {\'{e}}ph{\'{e}}m{\`{e}}res, il est utile, pour qui
  cherche {\`{a}} acqu{\'{e}}rir les connaissances et principes de base,
  dâinsister sur les aspects p{\'{e}}rennes du domaine. Cet ouvrage fait
  suite {\`{a}} R{\'{e}}seaux de neurones, m{\'{e}}thodologies et applications,
  des m{\^{e}}mes auteurs, paru en 2000, r{\'{e}}{\'{e}}dit{\'{e}} en 2004,
  chez le m{\^{e}}me {\'{e}}diteur, puis publi{\'{e}} en traduction anglaise
  chez Springer. Consacr{\'{e}} essentiellement aux r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones
  et aux cartes auto-adaptatives, il a largement contribu{\'{e}} {\`{a}}
  populariser ces techniques et {\`{a}} convaincre leurs utilisateurs quâil
  est possible dâobtenir des r{\'{e}}sultats remarquables, {\`{a}} condition
  de mettre en {\oe}uvre une m{\'{e}}thodologie de conception rigoureuse,
  scientifique- ment fond{\'{e}}e, dans un domaine o{\`{u}} lâempirisme a
  longtemps tenu lieu de m{\'{e}}thode. Tout en restant fid{\`{e}}le {\`{a}}
  lâesprit de cet ouvrage, combinant fondements math{\'{e}}matiques et
  m{\'{e}}thodologie de mise en {\oe}uvre, les auteurs ont {\'{e}}largi le
  champ de la pr{\'{e}}sentation, afin de permettre au lecteur dâaborder
  dâautres m{\'{e}}thodes dâapprentissage statistique que celles qui sont
  directement d{\'{e}}crites dans cet ouvrage. En effet, les succ{\`{e}}s de
  lâapprentissage dans un grand nombre de domaines ont pouss{\'{e}} au
  d{\'{e}}veloppement de tr{\`{e}}s nombreuses variantes, souvent
  destin{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} r{\'{e}}pondre efficacement aux exigences de telle ou
  telle classe dâapplications. Toutes ces variantes ont n{\'{e}}anmoins des
  bases th{\'{e}}oriques et des aspects m{\'{e}}thodolo- giques communs,
  quâil est important dâavoir pr{\'{e}}sents {\`{a}} lâesprit. Le terme
  dâapprentissage, comme celui de r{\'{e}}seau de neurones, {\'{e}}voque
  {\'{e}}videmment le fonctionnement du cerveau. Il ne faut pourtant pas
  sâattendre {\`{a}} trouver ici dâexplications sur les m{\'{e}}canismes de
  traitement des informations dans les syst{\`{e}}mes nerveux ; ces derniers
  sont dâune grande complexit{\'{e}}, r{\'{e}}sultant de processus
  {\'{e}}lectriques et chimiques subtils, encore mal compris en d{\'{e}}pit de
  la grande quantit{\'{e}} de donn{\'{e}}es exp{\'{e}}rimentales disponibles.
  Si les m{\'{e}}thodes dâapprentissage statistique peuvent {\^{e}}tre
  dâune grande utilit{\'{e}} pour cr{\'{e}}er des mod{\`{e}}les empiriques de
  telle ou telle fonction r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}}e par le syst{\`{e}}me nerveux,
  celles qui sont d{\'{e}}crites dans cet ouvrage nâont aucunement la
  pr{\'{e}}tention dâimiter, m{\^{e}}me vaguement, le fonctionne- ment du
  cerveau. Lâapprentissage artificiel, notamment statistique, permettra-t-il
  un jour de donner aux ordinateurs des capacit{\'{e}}s analogues {\`{a}}
  celles des {\^{e}}tres humains ? Se rapprochera-t-on de cet objectif en
  perfectionnant les techniques actuelles dâapprentissage, ou bien des
  approches radicalement nouvelles sont-elles indispensables ? Faut-il
  sâinspirer de ce que lâon sait, ou croit savoir, sur le fonctionnement du
  cerveau ? Ces questions font lâobjet de d{\'{e}}bats passionn{\'{e}}s, et
  passionnants, au sein de la communaut{\'{e}} scientifique : on nâen
  trouvera pas les r{\'{e}}ponses ici.%

  Among the simplest and most intuitively appealing classes of nonprobabilistic
  classification procedures are those that weight the evidence of nearby sample
  observations most heavily. More specifically, one might wish to weight the
  evidence of a neighbor close to an unclassified observation more heavily than
  the evidence of another neighbor which is at a greater distance from the
  unclassified observation. One such classification rule is described which
  makes use of a neighbor weighting function for the purpose of assigning a
  class to an unclassified sample. The admissibility of such a rule is also

  Time series is an important class of temporal data objects and it can be
  easily obtained from scientific and financial applications. A time series is
  a collection of observations made chronologically. The nature of time series
  data includes: large in data size, high dimensionality and necessary to
  update continuously. Moreover time series data, which is characterized by its
  numerical and continuous nature, is always considered as a whole instead of
  individual numerical field. The increasing use of time series data has
  initiated a great deal of research and development attempts in the field of
  data mining. The abundant research on time series data mining in the last
  decade could hamper the entry of interested researchers, due to its
  complexity. In this paper, a comprehensive revision on the existing time
  series data mining research is given. They are generally categorized into
  representation and indexing, similarity measure, segmentation, visualization

  When performing visualization and classification, people often confront the
  problem of dimensionality reduction. Isomap is one of the most promising
  nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. However, when Isomap is
  applied to real-world data, it shows some limitations, such as being
  sensitive to noise. In this paper, an improved version of Isomap, namely
  S-Isomap, is proposed. S-Isomap utilizes class information to guide the
  procedure of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Such a kind of procedure is
  called supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In S-Isomap, the
  neighborhood graph of the input data is constructed according to a certain
  kind of dissimilarity between data points, which is specially designed to
  integrate the class information. The dissimilarity has several good
  properties which help to discover the true neighborhood of the data and,
  thus, makes S-Isomap a robust technique for both visualization and
  classification, especially for real-world problems. In the visualization
  experiments, S-Isomap is compared with Isomap, LLE, and WeightedIso. The
  results show that S-Isomap performs the best. In the classification
  experiments, S-Isomap is used as a preprocess of classification and compared
  with Isomap, WeightedIso, as well as some other well-established
  classification methods, including the K-nearest neighbor classifier, BP
  neural network, J4.8 decision tree, and SVM. The results reveal that S-Isomap
  excels compared to Isomap and WeightedIso in classification, and it is highly
  competitive with those well-known classification methods.%

  CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCI often prefer SPC than other methods offered to
  them, because of quality-of-life issues. The incidence of significant
  complications might not be as high as previously reported, and with a

  them and combine them into a single feature vector which is classified by a
  Support Vector Machine (SVM). The two global systems recognize faces by
  classifying a single feature vector consisting of the gray values of the
  whole face image. In the first global system we trained a single SVM
  classifier for each person in the database. The second system consists of
  sets of viewpoint-specific SVM classifiers and involves clustering during
  training. We performed extensive tests on a database which included faces
  rotated up to about 40Â° in depth. The component system clearly outperformed
  both global systems on all tests.%

  In this paper, a hybrid forecasting approach, which combines the Ensemble
  Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM), is
  proposed to improve the quality of wind speed forecasting. The essence of the
  methodology incorporates three phases. First, the original data of wind speed
  are decomposed into a number of independent Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)
  and one residual series by EEMD using the principle of decomposition. In
  order to forecast these IMFs, excepting the highest frequency acquired by
  EEMD, the respective estimates are yielded using the SVM algorithm. Finally,
  these respective estimates are combined into the final wind speed forecasts
  using the principle of ensemble. The proposed hybrid method is examined by
  forecasting the mean monthly wind speed of three wind farms located in
  northwest China. The obtained results confirm an observable improvement for
  the forecasting validity of the proposed hybrid approach. This tool shows
  great promise for the forecasting of intricate time series which are
  intrinsically highly volatile and irregular. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.%

  Dynamic time warping (DTW), which finds the minimum path by providing
  non-linear alignments between two time series, has been widely used as a
  distance measure for time series classification and clustering. However, DTW
  does not account for the relative importance regarding the phase difference
  between a reference point and a testing point. This may lead to
  misclassification especially in applications where the shape similarity
  between two sequences is a major consideration for an accurate recognition.
  Therefore, we propose a novel distance measure, called a weighted DTW (WDTW),
  which is a penalty-based DTW. Our approach penalizes points with higher phase
  difference between a reference point and a testing point in order to prevent
  minimum distance distortion caused by outliers. The rationale underlying the
  proposed distance measure is demonstrated with some illustrative examples. A
  new weight function, called the modified logistic weight function (MLWF), is
  also proposed to systematically assign weights as a function of the phase
  difference between a reference point and a testing point. By applying
  different weights to adjacent points, the proposed algorithm can enhance the
  detection of similarity between two time series. We show that some popular
  distance measures such as DTW and Euclidean distance are special cases of our
  proposed WDTW measure. We extend the proposed idea to other variants of DTW
  such as derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and propose the weighted
  version of DDTW. We have compared the performances of our proposed procedures
  with other popular approaches using public data sets available through the
  UCR Time Series Data Mining Archive for both time series classification and
  clustering problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed
  approaches can achieve improved accuracy for time series classification and
  clustering problems.%

  Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations, data
  items, or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). The clustering problem has
  been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this
  reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory
  data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially,
  and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made
  the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This
  paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical
  pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and
  references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of
  clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and
  identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some
  important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation,
  object recognition, and information retrieval.%

  In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in mining time

  the data is the key to efficient and effective solutions. One of the most
  commonly used representations is piecewise linear approximation. This
  representation has been used by various researchers to support clustering,

  variety of algorithms have been proposed to obtain this representation, with
  several algorithms having been independently rediscovered several times. In

  Classification of objects is an important area of research and application in
  a variety of fields. In the presence of full knowledge of the underlying
  probabilities, Bayes decision theory gives optimal error rates. In those
  cases where this information is not present, many algorithms make use of
  distance or similarity among samples as a means of classification. The
  K-nearest neighbor decision rule has often been used in these pattern
  recognition problems. One of the difficulties that arises when utilizing this
  technique is that each of the labeled samples is given equal importance in
  deciding the class memberships of the pattern to be classified, regardless of
  their `typicalness'. The theory of fuzzy sets is introduced into the
  K-nearest neighbor technique to develop a fuzzy version of the algorithm.
  Three methods of assigning fuzzy memberships to the labeled samples are
  proposed, and experimental results and comparisons to the crisp version are
  presented.%

  The problem of indexing time series has attracted much interest. Most
  algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some
  variation thereof. However, it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean
  distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dy- namic time warping (DTW) is
  a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes
  to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this
  flexi- bility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance.
  Unfortunately, however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality and thus
  has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have
  introduced approximate indexing techniques or abandoned the idea of indexing
  and concentrated on speeding up sequential searches. In this work, we intro-
  duce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our
  method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority
  over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of
  time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.%

  Time series of remote sensing imagery or derived vegetation indices and
  biophysical products have been shown particularly useful to characterize land
  ecosystem dynamics. Various methods have been developed based on temporal
  trajectory analysis to characterize, classify and detect changes in ecosystem
  dynamics. Although time series similarity measures play an important role in
  these methods, a quantitative comparison of the similarity measures is
  lacking. The objective of this study was to provide an overview and
  quantitative comparison of the similarity measures in function of varying
  time series and ecosystem characteristics, such as amplitude, timing and
  noise effects. For this purpose, the performance was evaluated for the
  commonly used similarity measures (D), ranging from Manhattan (DMan),
  Euclidean (DE) and Mahalanobis (DMah) distance measures, to correlation
  (DCC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA; DPCA) and Fourier based
  (DFFT,D$\xi$,DFk) similarities. The quantitative comparison consists of a
  series of Monte-Carlo simulations based on subsets of global MODIS Normalized
  Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and
  Leaf Area Index (LAI) data. Results of the simulations reveal four main
  groups of time series similarity measures with different sensitivities: (i)
  DMan, DE, DPCA, DFk quantify the difference in time series values, (ii) DMah
  accounts for temporal correlation and non-stationarity of variance, (iii) DCC
  measures the temporal correlation, and (iv) the Fourier based DFFT and D$\xi$
  show their specific sensitivity based on the selected Fourier components. The
  difference measures show relatively the highest sensitivity to amplitude
  effects, whereas the correlation based measures are highly sensitive to
  variations in timing and noise. The Fourier based measures, finally, depend
  highly on the signal to noise ratio and the balance between amplitude and
  phase dominance. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of each D stresses the
  importance of (i) understanding the time series characteristics before
  applying any classification of change detection approach and (ii) defining
  the variability one wants to identify/account for. This requires an
  understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and time series characteristics
  related to the baseline, amplitude, timing, noise and variability of the
  ecosystem time series. This is also illustrated in the quantitative
  comparison, where the different sensitivities of D for the NDVI, EVI, and LAI
  data relate specifically to the temporal characteristics of each data set.
  Additionally, the effect of noise and intra- and interclass variability is
  demonstrated in a case study based on land cover classification.%

  Most data stream classification algorithms need to supply input with a large
  amount of precisely labeled data. However, in many data stream applications,
  streaming data contains inherent uncertainty, and labeled samples are
  difficult to be collected, while abundant data are unlabeled. In this paper,
  we focus on classifying uncertain data streams with only positive and
  unlabeled samples available. Based on concept-adapting very fast decision
  tree (CVFDT) algorithm, we propose an algorithm namely puuCVFDT (CVFDT for
  positive and unlabeled uncertain data). Experimental results on both
  synthetic and real-life datasets demonstrate the strong ability and
  efficiency of puuCVFDT to handle concept drift with uncertainty under
  positive and unlabeled learning scenario. Even when 90{\%} of the samples in
  the stream are unlabeled, the classification performance of the proposed
  algorithm is still compared to that of CVFDT, which is learned from fully
  labeled data without uncertainty. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.%

  The parallel explosions of interest in streaming data, and data mining of
  time series have had surprisingly little intersection. This is in spite of
  the fact that time series data are typically streaming data. The main reason
  for this apparent paradox is the fact that the vast majority of work on
  streaming data explicitly assumes that the data is discrete, whereas the vast
  majority of time series data is real valued.Many researchers have also
  considered transforming real valued time series into symbolic
  representations, nothing that such representations would potentially allow
  researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the
  text processing and bioinformatics communities, in addition to allowing
  formerly "batch-only" problems to be tackled by the streaming community.
  While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over
  the past decades, they all suffer from three fatal flaws. Firstly, the
  dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original
  data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with
  dimensionality. Secondly, although distance measures can be defined on the
  symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with
  distance measures defined on the original time series. Finally, most of these
  symbolic approaches require one to have access to all the data, before
  creating the symbolic representation. This last feature explicitly thwarts
  efforts to use the representations with streaming algorithms.In this work we
  introduce a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is
  unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also
  allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower
  bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we
  shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it
  allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently
  manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the
  algorithms that operate on the original data. Finally, our representation
  allows the real valued data to be converted in a streaming fashion, with only
  an infinitesimal time and space overhead.We will demonstrate the utility of
  our representation on the classic data mining tasks of clustering,
  classification, query by content and anomaly detection.%

  Time series clustering is an active research area with applications in a wide
  range of fields. One key component in cluster analysis is determining a
  proper dissimilarity mea- sure between two data objects, and many criteria
  have been proposed in the literature to assess dissimilarity between two time
  series. The R package TSclust is aimed to im- plement a large set of
  well-established peer-reviewed time series dissimilarity measures, including
  measures based on raw data, extracted features, underlying parametric models,
  complexity levels, and forecast behaviors. Computation of these measures
  allows the user to perform clustering by using conventional clustering
  algorithms. TSclust also includes a clustering procedure based on p values
  from checking the equality of generating models, and some utilities to
  evaluate cluster solutions. The implemented dissimilarity functions are
  accessible individually for an easier extension and possible use out of the
  clustering context. The main features of TSclust are described and examples
  of its use are presented.%

  More and more people express their opinions on social media such as Facebook
  and Twitter. Predictive analysis on social media time-series allows the
  stake-holders to leverage this immediate, accessible and vast reachable
  communication channel to react and proact against the public opinion. In
  particular, understanding and predicting the sentiment change of the public
  opinions will allow business and government agencies to react against
  negative sentiment and design strategies such as dispelling rumors and post
  balanced messages to revert the public opinion. In this paper, we present a
  strategy of building statistical models from the social media dynamics to
  predict collective sentiment dynamics. We model the collective sentiment
  change without delving into micro analysis of individual tweets or users and
  their corresponding low level network structures. Experiments on large-scale
  Twitter data show that the model can achieve above 85{\%} accuracy on
  directional sentiment prediction.%

  Many pattern recognition algorithms are based on the nearest-neighbour search
  and use the well-known edit distance, for which the primitive edit costs are
  usually fixed in advance. In this article, we aim at learning an unbiased
  stochastic edit distance in the form of a finite-state transducer from a
  corpus of (input, output) pairs of strings. Contrary to the other standard
  methods, which generally use the Expectation Maximisation algorithm, our
  algorithm learns a transducer independently on the marginal probability
  distribution of the input strings. Such an unbiased way to proceed requires
  to optimise the parameters of a conditional transducer instead of a joint
  one. We apply our new model in the context of handwritten digit recognition.
  We show, carrying out a large series of experiments, that it always
  outperforms the standard edit distance. ?? 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.%

  We present a shape-based method for automatic people detection and counting
  without any assumption concerning camera motion. In order to evaluate the
  robustness of the proposed method, we apply it for classifying athletics
  videos into two classes: videos of individual and videos of team sports. The
  videos used are real and characterized by dynamic and unconstrained
  environment. Moreover, in the case of team sport, we propose a shape
  deformations based method for running/hurdling discrimination (activity
  recognition). Robust, adaptive and independent from color, illumination
  changes and the camera motion, the proposed features are combined in the
  Transferable Belief Model (TBM) framework providing a two-level (frames and
  shot) video categorization. Experimental results of 97{\%} of accuracy for
  individual/team sport categorization using a dataset of 252 real videos of
  athletic meetings, acquired by moving cameras under varying view angles,
  indicate the stability and the good performance of the proposed scheme.%

  To classify time series by nearest neighbors, we need to specify or learn one
  or several distance measures. We consider variations of the Mahalanobis
  distance measures which rely on the inverse covariance matrix of the data.
  Unfortunately --- for time series data --- the covariance matrix has often
  low rank. To alleviate this problem we can either use a pseudoinverse,
  covariance shrinking or limit the matrix to its diagonal. We review these
  alternatives and benchmark them against competitive methods such as the
  related Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification (LMNN) and the Dynamic
  Time Warping (DTW) distance. As we expected, we find that the DTW is
  superior, but the Mahalanobis distance measures are one to two orders of
  magnitude faster. To get best results with Mahalanobis distance measures, we
  recommend learning one distance measure per class using either covariance
  shrinking or the diagonal approach.%

  Recent literature has demonstrated the applicability of genetic programming
  to induction of decision trees for modelling toxicity endpoints. Compared
  with other decision tree induction techniques that are based upon recursive
  partitioning employing greedy searches to choose the best splitting attribute
  and value at each node that will necessarily miss regions of the search
  space, the genetic programming based approach can overcome the problem.
  However, the method still requires the discretization of the often
  continuous-valued toxicity endpoints prior to the tree induction. A novel
  extension of this method, YAdapt, is introduced in this work which models the
  original continuous endpoint by adaptively finding suitable ranges to
  describe the endpoints during the tree induction process, removing the need
  for discretization prior to tree induction and allowing the ordinal nature of
  the endpoint to be taken into account in the models built.%

  use to only small time series data sets. In this paper we introduce FastDTW,

  uses a multilevel approach that recursively projects a solution from a coarse

  This paper reports on an optimum dynamic programming (DP) based
  time-normalization algorithm for spoken word recognition. First, a general
  principle of time-normalization is given using timewarping function. Then,
  two time-normalized distance definitions, d e d symmetric and asymmetric
  forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each
  other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric
  form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope
  constraint, is successfully introduced, iwn hich the warping function slope
  isr estricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different
  categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively
  analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through
  experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to
  experimentat comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to
  spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows
  that the present algorithm gives no more than about twothirds errors, even

  This paper discusses a probabilistic model-based approach to clustering
  sequences, using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The problem can be framed as a
  generalization of the standard mixture model approach to clustering in
  feature space. Two primary issues are addressed. First, a novel parameter
  initialization procedure is proposed, and second, the more difficult problem
  of determining the number of clusters K, from the data, is investigated.
  Experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques are useful for
  revealing hidden cluster structure in data sets of sequences. 1 Introduction
  Consider a data set D consisting of N sequences, D = fS 1 ; . . . ; SN g. S i
  = (x i 1 ; . . . x i L i is a sequence of length L i composed of potentially
  multivariate feature vectors x. The problem addressed in this paper is the

  Standard Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) computation technique
  utilizes discrete cosine transform (DCT) for decorrelating log energies of
  filter bank output. The use of DCT is reasonable here as the covariance
  matrix of Mel filter bank log energy (MFLE) can be compared with that of
  highly correlated Markov-I process. This full-band based MFCC computation
  technique where each of the filter bank output has contribution to all
  coefficients, has two main disadvantages. First, the covariance matrix of the
  log energies does not exactly follow Markov-I property. Second, full-band
  based MFCC feature gets severely degraded when speech signal is corrupted
  with narrow-band channel noise, though few filter bank outputs may remain
  unaffected. In this work, we have studied a class of linear transformation
  techniques based on block wise transformation of MFLE which effectively
  decorrelate the filter bank log energies and also capture speech information
  in an efficient manner. A thorough study has been carried out on the block
  based transformation approach by investigating a new partitioning technique
  that highlights associated advantages. This article also reports a novel
  feature extraction scheme which captures complementary information to wide
  band information; that otherwise remains undetected by standard MFCC and
  proposed block transform (BT) techniques. The proposed features are evaluated
  on NIST SRE databases using Gaussian mixture model-universal background model
  (GMM-UBM) based speaker recognition system. We have obtained significant
  performance improvement over baseline features for both matched and
  mismatched condition, also for standard and narrow-band noises. The proposed
  method achieves significant performance improvement in presence of
  narrow-band noise when clubbed with missing feature theory based score
  computation scheme. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.%

  Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an
  important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small
  molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small
  molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19
  non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction
  accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition,
  scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based
  implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10
  scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the
  interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP
  settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in
  the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the
  accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success
  for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was
  performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was
  available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We
  analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most
  accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges,
  defining a domain of applicability for this approach.%

  : A new method for recognition of isolated handwritten Arabic/Persian digits
  is presented. This method is based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and a
  new approach of feature extraction. Each digit is considered from four
  different views, and from each view 16 features are extracted and combined to
  obtain 64 features. Using these features, multiple SVM classifiers are
  trained to separate different classes of digits. CENPARMI Indian
  (Arabic/Persian) handwritten digit database is used for training and testing
  of SVM classifiers. Based on this database, differences between Arabic and
  Persian digits in digit recognition are shown. This database provides 7390
  samples for training and 3035 samples for testing from the real life samples.
  Experiments show that the proposed features can provide a very good
  recognition result using Support Vector Machines at a recognition rate
  94.14{\%}, compared with 91.25 {\%} obtained by MLP neural network classifier
  using the same features and test set.%

  A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples
  taken from time series of the El Ni{\~{n}}oâSouthern Oscillation (ENSO).
  The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice
  of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length
  time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier
  frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are
  developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise
  processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence
  intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to
  increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given
  for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals.
  Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovm{\"{o}}ller,
  cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical
  significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO
  variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to
  1871, the Ni{\~{n}}o3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation
  index show significantly higher power during 1880â1920 and 1960â90, and
  lower power during 1920â60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of
  variance. The power Hovm{\"{o}}ller of sea level pressure shows significant
  variations in 2â8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.%

  The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification depends significantly
  on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this
  paper, we show how to learn a Maha- lanobis distance metric for kNN
  classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently
  be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes
  kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is
  trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same
  class while examples from different classes are separated by a largemargin.
  As in support vectormachines (SVMs), themargin criterion leads to a convex
  optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our
  approach re- quires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as
  opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance
  metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data
  sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way
  lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these
  results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and
  learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and
  combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner. Keywords: convex

  We study the problem of learning local metrics for nearest neighbor
  classification. Most previous works on local metric learning learn a number
  of local unrelated metrics. While this âindependenceâ approach delivers
  an increased flexibility its downside is the considerable risk of
  overfitting. We present a newparametric local metric learning method in which
  we learn a smooth metric matrix function over the data manifold. Using an
  approximation error bound of the metric matrix function we learn local
  metrics as linear combinations of basis metrics defined on anchor points over
  different regions of the instance space. We constrain the metric matrix
  function by imposing on the linear combinations manifold regularization which
  makes the learned metric matrix function vary smoothly along the geodesics of
  the data manifold. Our metric learning method has excellent performance both
  in terms of predictive power and scalability. We experimented with several
  large- scale classification problems, tens of thousands of instances, and
  compared it with several state of the art metric learning methods, both
  global and local, as well as to SVM with automatic kernel selection, all of
  which it outperforms in a significant manner.%

  Many algorithms have been proposed for the problem of time series
  classification. However, it is clear that one-nearest-neighbor with Dynamic
  Time Warping (DTW) distance is exceptionally difficult to beat. This approach
  has one weakness, however; it is computationally too demanding for many
  realtime applications. One way to mitigate this problem is to speed up the
  DTW calculations. Nonetheless, there is a limit to how much this can help. In
  this work, we propose an additional technique, numerosity reduction, to speed
  up one-nearest-neighbor DTW. While the idea of numerosity reduction for
  nearest-neighbor classifiers has a long history, we show here that we can
  leverage off an original observation about the relationship between dataset
  size and DTW constraints to produce an extremely compact dataset with little
  or no loss in accuracy. We test our ideas with a comprehensive set of
  experiments, and show that it can efficiently produce extremely fast accurate
  classifiers.%

  Recent work in metric learning has significantly improved the
  state-of-the-art in k-nearest neighbor classification. Support vector
  machines (SVM), particularly with RBF kernels, are amongst the most popular
  classification algorithms that uses distance metrics to compare examples.
  This paper provides an empirical analysis of the efficacy of three of the
  most popular Mahalanobis metric learning algorithms as pre-processing for SVM
  training. We show that none of these algorithms generate metrics that lead to
  particularly satisfying improvements for SVM-RBF classification. As a remedy
  we introduce support vector metric learning (SVML), a novel algorithm that
  seamlessly combines the learning of a Mahalanobis metric with the training of
  the RBF-SVM parameters. We demonstrate the capabilities of SVML on nine
  benchmark data sets of varying sizes and difficulties. In our study, SVML
  outperforms all alternative state-of-the-art metric learning algorithms in
  terms of accuracy and establishes itself as a serious alternative to the
  standard Euclidean metric with model selection by cross validation.%

  Event detection is a critical task in sensor networks, especially for
  environmental monitoring applications. Traditional solutions to event
  detection are based on analyzing one-shot data points, which might incur a
  high false alarm rate because sensor data is inherently unreliable and noisy.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel Distributed Single-pass Incremental
  Clustering (DSIC) technique to cluster the time series obtained at sensor
  nodes based on their underlying trends. In order to achieve scalability and
  energy-efficiency, our DSIC technique uses a hierarchical structure of sensor
  networks as the underlying infrastructure. The algorithm first compresses the
  time series produced at individual sensor nodes into a compact representation
  using Haar wavelet transform, and then, based on dynamic time warping
  distances, hierarchically groups the approximate time series into a global
  clustering model in an incremental manner. Experimental results on both real
  data and synthetic data demonstrate that our DSIC algorithm is accurate,
  energy-efficient and robust with respect to network topology changes.%

  This paper reports a controlled study with statistical signifi cance tests on
  five text categorization methods: the Support Vector Machines (SVM), a
  kNearest Neighbor (kNN) clas sifier, a neural network (NNet) approach, the
  Linear Least squares Fit (LLSF) mapping and a Naive Bayes (NB) classi fier.
  We focus on the robustness of these methods in dealing with a skewed category
  distribution, and their performance as function of the trainingset category
  frequency. Our re sults show that SVM, kNN and LLSF significantly outper form
  NNet and NB when the number of positive training instances per category are
  small (less than ten), and that all the methods perform comparably when the
  categories are sufficiently common (over 300 instances).%

  In this paper, we propose a multiple-metric learning algorithm to learn
  jointly a set of optimal homogenous/ heterogeneous metrics in order to fuse
  the data collected from multiple sensors for joint classification. The
  learned metrics have the potential to perform better than the conventional
  Euclidean metric for classification. Moreover, in the case of heterogenous
  sensors, the learned multiple metrics can be quite different, which are
  adapted to each type of sensor. By learning the multiple metrics jointly
  within a single unified optimization framework, we can learn better metrics
  to fuse the multi-sensor data for a joint classification. Furthermore, we
  also exploit multi-metric learning in a kernel induced feature space to
  capture the non-linearity in the original feature space via kernel mapping.

  Distance metric learning plays a very crucial role in many data mining
  algorithms because the performance of an algorithm relies heavily on choosing
  a good metric. However, the labeled data available in many applications is
  scarce and hence the metrics learned are often unsatisfactory. In this paper,
  we consider a transfer learning setting in which some related source tasks
  with labeled data are available to help the learning of the target task. We
  first propose a convex formulation for multi-task metric learning by modeling
  the task relationships in the form of a task covariance matrix. Then we
  regard transfer learning as a special case of multitask learning and adapt
  the formulation of multi-task metric learning to the transfer learning
  setting for our method, called transfer metric learning (TML). In TML, we
  learn the metric and the task covariances between the source tasks and the
  target task under a unified convex formulation. To solve the convex
  optimization problem, we use an alternating method in which each subproblem
  has an efficient solution. Experimental results on some commonly used
  transfer learning applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
