\part*{Conclusion of Part I}
This first part of the manuscript presents a state of the art of classic Machine Learning framework and algorithms to make the classification or the regression of time series. We note that the considered algorithms ($k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)) are based on the comparison of time series through distance measures. 

Considering time series as static data lead to the only comparison based on their amplitude and the same time instant. To take into account other specifities of time series (behavior, frequential components), other metrics (e.g., the temporal correlation $d_B$, the frequential-based distance $d_F$, etc.) and other methods (Dynamic Time Warping {\sc dtw}, dichotomy) have been proposed to cope with temporal characteristics. 

Learning an adequate metric is a key challenge to well classify time series. Inspired by Metric Learning work for static data, we propose in the following a framework to learn a Multi-modal and Multi-scale Metric for a robust nearest neighbor classifier of time series.
