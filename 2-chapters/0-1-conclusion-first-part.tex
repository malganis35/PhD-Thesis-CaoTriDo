\part*{Conclusion of Part I}
In order to make the classification or regression of time series, a lot of technics exist in the literature. Our work focus on $k$-NN classifier and the SVM will be used in the following for its large margin concept. We note that the $k$-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is based on the comparison of time series through distance measures. 

Considering time series as static data lead to the only comparison based on their amplitude and the same time. To take into account other specificities of time series (behavior, frequential components), other metrics (e.g., the temporal correlation $d_B$, the frequential-based distance $d_F$, etc.) and other methods (Dynamic Time Warping {\sc dtw}, dichotomy) have been proposed in the literature to cope with temporal characteristics. 

Learning an adequate metric is a key challenge to well classify time series. Inspired by Metric Learning work for static data, we propose in the following a framework to learn a Multi-modal and Multi-scale Metric for a robust nearest neighbor classifier of time series.
