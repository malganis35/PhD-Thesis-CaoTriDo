\part*{Conclusion of Part I}
This first part of the manuscrit present a state of the art of classic machine learning framework and algorithms to make the classification or the regression of time series. We note that the considered algorithms ($k$-NN, SVM) are based on the comparison of time series through distance measure. Considering time series as static data lead to compare time series only the comparison of their value, on the same instant between the two considered time series. To take into account over characteristics of time series, other metrics (cort, $d_F$, etc.) and other methods (DTW, dichomotie)  have been proposed to cope with these characteristics. Learning an adequate metrics is a key challenge to well classify time series. Inspired by the metric learning work, we propose in the following a framework to learn a multi-modal and multi-scale metric for a nearest neighbors classification.
