\part{Metric learning for time series from multiple modalities and multiple scales}
The first part has enlightened the importance of combining several modalities and several scales to compare time series in order to make a better classification. We propose, in this part, a framework to learn this metric. For that, the idea is to define a new space representation, the pairwise space, where a vector is a pair of time series which is described by the basic metrics. Then, we formalize the problem of learning the metric as an optimization problem and show its equivalence by solving an adequate SVM problem. In the first chapter, we present this pairwise representation and gives interpretation in this new space. In the second chapter, we formalize the optimization problem and its adapted SVM equivalence. In the third chapter, we present the details of the algorithm. In the final chapter, we experiment our proposed approach on datasets, discuss and interpret the results.
