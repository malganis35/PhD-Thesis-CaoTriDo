\part{Multi-modal and Multi-scale Time series Metric Learning ({\sc m$^2$tml})}
The first part has enlightened the importance of combining several modalities to make a better analysis (classification, regression) of time series.
% We propose, in this part, a framework to learn this metric. For that, the idea is to introduce a new space representation, the pairwise space, where a vector is a pair of time series described by several unimodal metrics. Then, we formalize the problem of learning the metric as an optimization problem and show its equivalence by solving an adequate Support Vector Machine (SVM) problem. 

In the first chapter, we present the pairwise representation and formalize the optimization problem and its adapted Support Vector Machine ({\sc svm}) approximation. In the second chapter, we present the details of the proposed algorithm: Multi-modal and Multi-scale Time series Metric Learning ({\sc m$^2$tml}).
