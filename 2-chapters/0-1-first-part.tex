\part{Work positioning}

The first part of the manuscript aims at positioning the work context. Our objective is to solve classification and regression problems for time series. The first chapter presents classic machine learning techniques for static data. In particular, we focus on $k$-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine approach. In the second chapter, we recall metrics used in the literature to compare time series and present the concept of metric learning. % Finally, we argue that learning an adequate distance is a key challenge to well classify time series by classic Machine Learning algorithms.
